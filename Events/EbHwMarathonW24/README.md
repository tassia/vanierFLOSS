Eastern Bloc Hardware Marathon - Winter 2024
=============================================

The Vanier-EasternBloc Hardware Marathon happened on February 24th 2024, on a
sunny winter Saturday.

Eastern Bloc (EB) is an art-technology gallery and maker space based in the
Chabanel neighborhood. In collaboration with Vanier FST & members of the FLOSS
Club, EB invited Vanier students for a day of activities.
 
The day started with a little tour of the EB labs, with plenty of machines and
tools to amaze any maker eyes: CNC, vinyl cutter, laser cutter, 3D printers, 3D
scanner, heatpress, etc. Then we had a workshop on hardware inventory, getting
ready to tackle the task of making an inventory of a pile of donated laptops,
tablets and phones. 

In exchange for the help, EB has offered a 3-month access to their labs and
machines to volunteers, from March to May 2024. It was also a great opportunity
for students to be exposed to a variety of hardware and learn about how to
recognize and inventory those, as well as to collect STAR hours for those interested.

Registration
============

An online form was setup and we announced that we had a limited number of spots
available. We were aiming to have max 15 people, including organizers, and we
ended up with 14, amazing!!!

Total of 13 students had registered, with 3 cancellations prior to the event. On
the day, among participants and organizers, we were 10 people working as
technicians, plus 3 kids and 1 Eastern Bloc staff.

Participants 
============

  - 3 Computer Science and Technology (CST) students
  - 2 CST graduates
  - 2 Computer Science and Mathematics students
  - 1 Accounting (Continuing Education) students
  - 1 Pure and Applied Sciences student
  - 1 Computer Science teacher

Workshop
=========

The workshop and inventory were facilitated by Giuliana Bouzon and Anthony Nadeau, both Vanier
alumni and members of the FLOSS club. The two of them have worked in computer
retail companies, and have plenty of experience on recognizing tech goodies.

Hardware inventory
==================

The very first step was to label machines with a sequential ID, and distribute piles
of 5 machines per seat, so each participant had an initial target.

An online spreadsheet had been prepared to collect the following info: ID, Serial Number,
Power Cable Included, Video Output,	Number of USB Ports,	Operating System,	Processor (CPU),
GPU name or Integrated, Memory (RAM),	Storage Size, WiFi or Ethernet,	Battery Functional (%),
Technician, Comments.

Participants were instructed to follow a series of steps and/or
commands, based on the operating system at hands. If no operating system could be booted,
we had plenty of USBs with Debian live systems to boot from and retrieve the needed
information. The spreadsheet was collaboratively filled, and at the end of the day we had
an inventory with 64 machines.

Lunch
=====

Lunch was provided by Vanier FST. Once more we had pizza, easy to handle
dietary restrictions. A good addition this time is that we have ordered
some desert to keep sugar a desired happy level ;-) 

Laptop Donation
=====

As a thank you to our efforts in this marathon, EB donated 15 laptops to us. 
After discussing what to do with these laptops, we came to the following conclusion:

- 5 for donation (India, or possibly bring to DebConf)
- 3 for raffle (next rounds of usability tests)
- 5 for Release Testing, Usability Testing, events & FLOSS club in general
- 2 for club members

There are just some ideas for the moment, and nothing is final.

Below are the assortment of laptops that we received:
1, 10, 25, 26, 41, 45, 56, 62, 63 - L430 Laptop (ThinkPad) - Type 2465
5, 28, 29, 31 - T420 Laptop (ThinkPad) - Type 4180
35 - T420 Laptop (ThinkPad) - Type 4236
36 - Dell Latitude E5440

Note: the numbers in front of the laptop models are the identification number for each one.
