The third edition of Vanier FLOSS Day happened on October 16th 2024, on a
Wednesday, during the school Fall break. All Vanier community was invited,
through MIOs and a [printed poster](FLOSS_day_24_poster.png). This time we
did not publicize the event outside the College, since we quickly reached our
room capacity.

Swag
====

All participants took home a FLOSS Day 3D printed keychain. On top of that,
a selection of FLOSS project stickers were printed and made available.

### 3D Printed Keychain

The keychain is based on a Tinkercad design of [IronGears10](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iPPfRoUBe1q-3d-pcb-layout) licensed based on CC BY-SA 3.0. There are some modification done. Final Tinkercad is shared [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lqzVt5o8N8M-vanier-floss-day-swag-3d), and you can find the final design in form of the Prusa Slicer project (`3mf`) in this repo.

We had a few prototypes experimenting corner design and color matching:

These are the design preview of the final design:

Then final design are made in batch by Vanier Makerspace and got ready before the FLOSS Day.

Schedule
==========

For the first time we had a pre-determined schedule. Here are the highlights:
- 2 intro sessions about FLOSS and how to contribute
- 2 guest talks: OpenStreetMap project (OSM) in the morning and Tor project in
the afternoon.
- 6 UNIX course students presented about GNU/Linux distributions
- a 7-speakers Lightning Talks session, where each participant had 3 min to share about a cool FLOSS project
- 3 hands-on workshops in parallel: OSM, Git, Debian packaging 

FIXME: add timetable and links to presentations

Drawing robot
===============

The Tor onion was being "cooked" as presentations were taking place, and by the
end of the day participants could appreciate the beautiful onion logo from Tor
project.

FIXME: add picture

Lunch and snacks
================

Snacks: coffee, fruits and pastries
Lunch: pizza, the easiest to handle dietary restrictions
