[WIP] please send a PR with your contribution to improve this report!

The third edition of Vanier FLOSS Day happened on October 16th 2024, on a
Wednesday, during the school Fall break. All Vanier community was invited,
through MIOs and a [printed poster](FLOSS_day_24_poster.png). This time we
did not publicize the event outside the College, since we quickly reached our
room capacity.

Participants
==============

An online form was setup and 58 people were registered prior to the event. On
the day, 44 people checked in: 

- Vanier community:
  - 10 Computer Science and Mathematics (CSM) students
  - 22 Computer Science and Technology (CST) students
  - 1 Vanier CS student (did not specify the program)
  - 2 Alumni
  - 3 Computer Science teachers
  - 1 Computer Engineering teacher
  - 1 Makerspace technician

- Outside from Vanier (guest speakers):
  - 2 McGill students (McGill Open Mapping Group)
  - 2 FLOSS developers (Tor and Debian projects)

This time we had less program diversity than last year, when several students from non-CS regular programs also attended the meeting. Among the cancellations and no-shows for this year, we had several students from Health Sciences, Electrical Engineering and CS continuing education programs. Something to strive for next year: keep those participants engaged until the day of the event.

Swag
====

All participants took home a FLOSS Day 3D printed keychain. On top of that,
a selection of FLOSS project stickers were printed and made available.

### 3D Printed Keychain (by Qian Qian)

The keychain is based on a Tinkercad design of [IronGears10](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iPPfRoUBe1q-3d-pcb-layout) licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0. There are some modification done. Final Tinkercad is shared [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lqzVt5o8N8M-vanier-floss-day-swag-3d), and you can find the final design in form of the Prusa Slicer project (`3mf`) in this repo.

We had a few prototypes experimenting corner design and color matching; and finally the design preview of the final design.

Then the final design was produced in batch by Vanier Makerspace and got ready before the FLOSS Day.

### FLOSS stickers (by Manas Patel and Anghelos Coulon)

We have also produced some stickers to give away. A couple of original designs for the FLOSS Day, and a few other official logos from FLOSS projects.

Schedule
==========

For the first time we had a pre-determined schedule. Here are the highlights:
- 2 intro sessions about FLOSS and how to contribute
- 2 guest talks: OpenStreetMap project (OSM) in the morning and Tor project in
the afternoon.
- 6 UNIX course students presented about GNU/Linux distributions
- a 7-speakers Lightning Talks session, where each participant had 3 min to share about a cool FLOSS project
- 3 hands-on workshops in parallel: OSM, Git, Debian packaging

Drawing robot
===============

The Tor project logo was being "cooked" by a robot as presentations were taking place, and by the
end of the day participants could appreciate the beautiful onion logo.
