The third edition of Vanier FLOSS Day happened on October 16th 2024, on a
Wednesday, during the school Fall break. All Vanier community was invited,
through MIOs and a [printed poster](FLOSS_day_24_poster.png). This time we
did not publicize the event outside the College, since we quickly reached our
room capacity.
